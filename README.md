### Hello, world! ðŸ˜†

I'm Sirawit "Plum" Pongnakintr (a.k.a Plurm). I'm a student of Bachelor of Science (Double Major in Mathematics and Computer Science) at Ã‰cole Polytechnique, France. Currently I'm a third-year (final year) student.

### Disclaimer ðŸ¤”

I don't support immoral capitalism, any act against justice, nor any illegal business. I do things on my own freedom without any immoral/injustice action. Even if I don't like excessive capitalism, I still look for money. In order to maintain the sustainability of my studies, financial support is very important for me. Feel free to contact me if you're interested to donate me something. Apart from my studies and basic quality of living, I consider money to have low importance. I live for life, not for money.

### Contact ðŸ˜®

ðŸ“« sirawit@pongnakin.com (More informal and simpler methods available once I know you!)

Also, my Codeforces handle is `Plurm`. For competitive programming related stuffs, you can contact me via Codeforces messaging system.

### Anything else?

ðŸ”­ I spend most of my time studying. Currently, I have no plan to do full-time work and currently I'm starting my research career. Job opportunities (part-time) are appreciated but please understand that I cannot commit a lot of time on working because I need to focus on studying.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about: group theory, Galois theory, introductory algebraic topology, commutative algebra, elliptic curves, functional programming, compilers, relational programming, complexity, constraint satisfaction problems (and the promise version).

âœ¨ I want to learn more about: modern geometry, modern number theory, algebraic geometry, arithmetic geometry, algebraic topology, functional analysis, approximation algorithms, cryptography, combinatorics, philosophy of science and humanity.

ðŸ¤” Unfortunately, I'm unable to teach right now because I'm already an assistant coach for the IOI training camp in Thailand. However, feel free to contact me if there are questions. I'll help if possible.

ðŸ‘¯ Feel free to contact me if you need some help (in case there are projects that you want me to collaborate, however, please note that I have less free time this year), but don't spam, scam, or phish, please. I'm quite unavailable this year, due to having to study, to participate in competitive programming, and to do research.

### Small comments

ðŸ’» Note that I went away from competitive programming for some time. However, right now I decided to come back and give it another try. So, yes, I'm still a competitive programmer! And I hope I can still do my best, to dream big, and to follow that dream (once again).

ðŸ”« I tried to play the role "chaotic good", and I'm still holding that "chaotic good" persona (though it is likely to change). There's a thin line between an antihero and a villain. I'm trying not to cross that line.

That's pretty much it! Good luck and have a nice day!
