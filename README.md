### Hello, world! ðŸ˜†

I'm Sirawit "Plum" Pongnakintr (a.k.a Plurm). I was a full-time software engineer, but now studying for the Bachelor of Science (Double Major in Mathematics and Computer Science) at Ã‰cole Polytechnique, France.

### Disclaimer ðŸ¤”

I don't support immoral capitalism, any act against justice, nor any illegal business. I do things on my own freedom without any immoral/injustice action. Even if I don't like excessive capitalism, I still look for money. In order to maintain the sustainability of my studies, financial support is very important for me. Feel free to contact me if you're interested to donate me something. Apart from my studies and basic quality of living, I consider money to have low importance. I live for life, not for money.

### Contact ðŸ˜®

ðŸ“« sirawit@pongnakin.com (More informal and simpler methods available once I know you!)

Also, my Codeforces handle is `Plurm`. For competitive programming related stuffs, you can contact me via Codeforces messaging system.

### Anything else?

ðŸ”­ I spend most of my time on studying and doing hobbies. Currently, I have no plan to do full-time work and currently I'm looking for opportunities to do researches. Job opportunities (part-time) are appreciated but please understand that I cannot commit a lot of time on working because I need to focus on studying also.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about: analytic number theory, algebraic number theory, abstract algebra, computational algebra, topology, automated proof systems.

âœ¨ I want to learn more about: geometry (non-Euclidean), constraint logic programming, distributed and concurrent computing, convex optimization, approximation algorithms, cryptography, Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics, quantum mechanics, string theory, philosophy of science and humanity.

ðŸ¤” Unfortunately, I'm unable to teach right now because I'm already a TA for olympiad camps in Thailand. However, feel free to contact me if there are questions. I'll help if possible.

ðŸ‘¯ Feel free to contact me if you need some help (in case there are projects that you want me to collaborate I'll look whether I have time to do it or not), but don't spam, scam, or phish, please. I'm quite available, but might be late on replies. 

Oh, and yes! I'm currently trying the Hacktoberfest! (not sure if it will be ok, anyway let me try ðŸ˜„)

That's pretty much it! Good luck and have a nice day!
