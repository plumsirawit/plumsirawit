### Hello, world! ðŸ˜†

I'm Sirawit "Plum" Pongnakintr (a.k.a Plurm). I was a full-time software engineer, currently studying in bachelor degree (not sure about my double major yet: maybe Math/CS or Math/Physics) at Ã‰cole Polytechnique, France.

### Disclaimer ðŸ¤”

I don't support immoral capitalism, any act against justice, nor any illegal business. I do things on my own freedom without any immoral/injustice action. Even if I don't like excessive capitalism, I still look for money. In order to maintain the sustainability of my studies, financial support is very important for me. Feel free to contact me if you're interested to donate me something. Apart from my studies and basic quality of living, I consider money to have low importance. I live for life, not for money.

### Anything else?

ðŸ”­ I spend most of my time on studying and doing hobbies. Currently, I have no plan to work but I'm looking for opportunities to do researches. Job opportunities might be appreciated but please understand that I cannot commit a lot of time on working. Because for me, studying is the most important thing to focus right now.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about: introduction to analysis, linear algebra, abstract algebra, polynomial rings, fast fourier transform, computer architecture, classical mechanics, basics of quantum mechanics, analytic number theory, elliptic curves.

âœ¨ I want to learn more about: topology, group theory, monstrous moonshine, string theory, algebraic number theory, Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progression, complex analysis, quantum gravity, constraint logic programming, distributed and concurrent computing, convex optimization, approximation algorithms, cryptography, Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics.

ðŸ¤” Unfortunately, I'm unable to teach right now because I'm already a TA for olympiad camps in Thailand. However, feel free to contact me if there are questions. I'll help if possible.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ... haha, solving the collatz conjecture, of course. Also, feel free to contact me if you need some help (in case there are projects that you want me to collaborate I'll look whether I have time to do it or not).

Feel free to contact me (but don't spam, scam, or phish, please). I'm quite available, but might be late on replies. 

That's pretty much it! Good luck and have a nice day!
